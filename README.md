# python_project1
This repository contains my Attendance_Management_Tool project. I have developed this website using the Django Framework, python and Sqlite3.
IDE used - Visual Studio Code.

   Highlights of the project are:
   1. A fully interactive interface.
   2. A simple navigation bar for the ease of the user.
   3. Storage of data in real time.
   4. Accessibility to the data stored in the databases.
   5. Access data as per need with the help of filters.
   6. Generate reports.

In adition to all these files there is a folder that contains all the scripts.
